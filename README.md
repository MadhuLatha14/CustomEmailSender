Custom Email Sender
This project is a personalized email-sending application that enables users to send customized emails by importing data from Google Sheets or CSV files. The system also supports email scheduling, throttling, tracking, and provides real-time email delivery analytics.

Key Features
Email Data Import: Fetch email data from Google Sheets or CSV files.
Account Integration: Securely connect email accounts using OAuth2 or SMTP protocols.
Customizable Email Content: Customize email content using dynamic placeholders for personalized communication.
Scheduling and Throttling: Send emails at scheduled intervals and control sending rate to prevent overload.
Email Tracking: Track email delivery statuses, including delivered, opened, and bounced.
Analytics Dashboard: Real-time reporting and analytics on sent emails and their delivery statuses.
Technologies Used
Backend: Flask (Python web framework)
Task Queue: Celery with Redis as the broker
Database: SQLAlchemy (ORM for database interaction)
Email Service Provider: SendGrid (for sending emails and tracking)
Frontend: HTML/CSS for building the user dashboard
Prerequisites
Ensure the following tools and accounts are set up before you begin:

Python 3.7+ installed on your system.
Redis (for Celery task management).
A SendGrid account for email sending and status tracking.
Installation Guide
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Custom-Email-Sender.git
cd Custom-Email-Sender
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up Redis (required for task scheduling):

Install Redis and run the server locally, or use a hosted Redis service like Redis Cloud.
Configuration
Create a .env file in the project root directory with the following environment variables:

bash
Copy code
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your-google-sheet-id
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///emails.db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
API Keys and Setup:

SendGrid: Create an account and generate your API key.
Google Sheets: Set up API access for Google Sheets to fetch data.
Database Setup
Initialize the database for storing email statuses:

bash
Copy code
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
Running the Application
Start the Celery worker to handle background tasks (email scheduling and sending):

bash
Copy code
celery -A tasks.celery worker --loglevel=info
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
flask run
Access the dashboard by visiting http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your web browser.

Usage
Upload Data: Import recipient data from Google Sheets or CSV files (including email addresses and dynamic fields).
Create Custom Emails: Define email templates with placeholders like {Company Name}, {Location}, etc., which will be replaced with real data from each row.
Email Scheduling: Schedule emails to be sent immediately or at specific intervals.
Analytics Dashboard: View real-time statistics on sent emails and delivery status, including success and failure metrics.
Testing
Before sending out emails to a large list, it's important to test the functionality:

Configure a smaller test dataset.
Ensure that emails are sent according to schedule, with throttling applied to avoid overloading the server.
Verify that email tracking (sent, opened, bounced) works as expected.
Deployment
To deploy the application in production:

Set up a production-ready database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
Use a production-ready server like Gunicorn to serve the Flask app.
Host Redis on a cloud provider (e.g., Redis Labs or AWS).
Deploy the app on a cloud platform such as AWS, DigitalOcean, or Heroku.
